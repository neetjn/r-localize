# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project!

Please use the following guidelines to save yourself and the maintainers some time, as well as keep the project organized.

Last Updated: **2/2/2018**

### I. Code Guidelines

Please follow the coding style established in the rest of the codebase.

**Semicolons**

No semicolons, please!

**Spacing**

Use two spaces for indentation. No tabs. Spacing around brackets: if (foo) { instead of if(foo){

**Quotes**

Single-quoted strings are preferred to double-quoted strings.

### II. Creating a branch

* Any new features must include a test with coverage.
* Branches for bugs and features should be structured like so, `issue-x-username`.

### III. Testing

Before putting in a pull request, be sure to verify you've built all your changes and your changes pass our provided tests.

To run your tests, use `npm run test`.

### IV. Creating Issues

Use the [issue template](https://github.com/neetjn/r-localize/blob/master/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) when creating a new issue.

The best way to get your bug fixed is to provide a reduced test case. jsFiddle, jsBin, and other sites provide a way to give live examples.
